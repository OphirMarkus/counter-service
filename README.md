# counter-service
Checkpoint Exam App Code

1. Created a Minimal Dockerfile that has everything the app needs and tested it
2. Wrote a Github Actions pipeline that builds and pushes the image to an AWS ECR
3. Made it so the counter would count GET requests in addition to the POST requests

The whole proccess took me no more than 30 minutes of work.
